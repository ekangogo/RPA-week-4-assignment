# [ Week 4 ] Independent Project
####The project is an excel automation challenge comrising of 2 challenges:

Challenge 1:
Calculate the sum of the values from two columns in an Excel file in 3 ways. Create a workflow that adds the values on column A with values on column B and writes them in column C in different ways:

1. Keeps the Excel open and writes the results in real-time, row by row so you can see the changes.
2. Keeps the Excel closed, set the column values in the memory DataTable, and adds all the tables to a new Excel file at once, in the end.
3. Calculates the sum by using Excel formulas in the original file.
Note:  Sample Columns.xlsx is provided

Challenge 2
We have a list of expenses (rent, food, utilities, leisure, savings) for which card payments were made. We have discovered that some transactions are missing, as they were done in cash. Prepare a workflow to bring all the expenses in a single file and calculate the percentages for each expense made.
